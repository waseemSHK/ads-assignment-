i.Describe Named Entity Recognition. 

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and categorizing named entities within a text. These entities can include names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, and more. NER typically involves tokenizing the input text, assigning part-of-speech tags to each token, and then classifying them into predefined categories. This classification is often performed using machine learning techniques such as statistical models or deep learning architectures trained on labeled datasets. NER plays a crucial role in various NLP applications, including information retrieval, question answering, and sentiment analysis, by enabling the extraction of structured information from unstructured text data.

ii. Write a python code to recognize named entities in a document. The input should be a text file containing 200 - 300 words in it. The output should be written to another file. 


Consider the 	Zacharyâ€™s karate club network from the movie karate kids. Here Zachary tried to analyze conflicts and fission in small groups. The dataset called karate.gml 	can be read using NetworkX and can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7985174.v1 .[GML - Graph Modelling Language.]  It contains 34 nodes representing individuals within the karate club. The edges in the network are given by interactions between two individuals outside the activities of the club such as actual lessons or meetings. 
		 	 	 		
i. create a graph from the 	karate.gml file. Display all the basic information about the network.
ii. Store all the metadata of the actors in the network.
iii. Calculate all types of centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, pagerank centrality). Analyse the nodes based on the centrality values. Write a note on this. 
iv. Find the possible k-components of the network and the clustering coefficient.
v. Find out the communities using Girvan-Newman algorithm and Louvain method.
